THE DETAILS

Party Fowl loyalty/rewards is easy to use, and signing up is easy! Just go to partyfowl.com/rewards to enter your information and get started toward earning. You can also fill out this information at checkout when you order online to any Party Fowl location. You can also accrue/redeem points for any online order or in-store purchase at any Party Fowl location, excluding Nissan Stadium and Nashville International Airport - BNA.

Party Fowl is on a points-based reward system. This means that for every $1 you spend, you accrue 10 points (plus you get 100 free points for signing up)! You can stay up-to-date on the latest and greatest from Party Fowl, including special offers based on your point status! Yep, we reward you for eating Nashville Hot Chicken. Does it get any better than that?!

Rewards earned are active and available to redeem for up to 30 days from the accrual date. After the 30 days, the reward is no longer active and cannot be recovered. Points earned do not expire.

Online loyalty/REWARDS

When ordering online, simply choose to Sign In or Sign Up and your account will begin accruing points toward your purchases. If you select Checkout as Guest, you will not accrue any loyalty points, and an account will not be created.

When your account is created, all of your receipts and orders henceforth will be stored in your loyalty account for easy access to previous history.

IN-STORE loyalty/Rewards

When accruing/redeeming your points in-store, your server can look up your account by last name, phone number, or email. Once your account is applied to your check, you’re done! Points accrued from your check total will be automatically applied to your account. Any rewards accrued during this visit can be redeemed on your next purchase; if you already have rewards available, you can redeem your reward on this purchase, or you can save your reward for your next visit. Note that rewards expire 30 days after accrual, but points on the account do not expire.

When your account is created, all of your receipts and orders henceforth will be stored in your loyalty account for easy access to previous history.

LOYALTY/REWARDS TERMS AND CONDITIONS

We love saving you money! This is why we have implemented a new guest loyalty that will make it easier for you to get free stuff. Pretty cool, huh? We also like to keep you in the loop, so here are the terms of our loyalty/rewards program:

Rewards are only available through Party Fowl’s online ordering platform or in-store purchases. Party Fowl cannot and will not honor loyalty/rewards accrual or redemption on any other ordering platform or online merchandise purchases, per our system’s function, which is tied to our in-store point of sale system and personalized to your specific account created through Party Fowl MyGuestAccount.

Party Fowl is not authorized to redeem multiple rewards during one visit; only one redemption is available per purchase. Rewards are not to be combined with any other promotion or discount, including Happy Hour, in-store promotions, or any other pre-set discount honored by Party Fowl. Rewards are NEVER valid on the sale of alcohol, per the laws and requirements set by TABC. The parameters of this program are pre-configured in our point of sale system and cannot be altered or overridden in any way. If you opt in for emails from Party Fowl and you receive an email with your reward, this is not your reward, and no extra discount will be honored for in-store purchases. All rewards are automatically applied to your rewards account and can only be redeemed by logging into your account online or in-store.

Party Fowl reserves the right to change the terms of the loyalty/rewards program at any time, without notice to the guest or account holder.

By creating a loyalty account and through the continued use of said account, this acts as an agreement that the accountholder has read and agreed to the terms and conditions on this page set forth by Party Fowl.

We’re loyal to you too! We don’t sell your data. Click here to view our Privacy Policy.

Contacting us about your account/rewards

If you believe your account rewards balance to be incorrect, or if you simply forgot to sign in to rewards either online or in-store, please visit our rewards contact page, and someone from Party Fowl will contact you to review your account.

As this is a new system for us, we appreciate your patience with us as we work to optimize this system for the best guest experience. If you have any questions, comments, or suggestions, please let us know at our general contact page and include Rewards in the subject line.
