#  Privacy Policy

 
Party Fowl knows that you care how information about you is used and shared, and we appreciate your trust that we will do so carefully and sensibly. We respect the privacy rights of our customers and recognize the importance of protecting the information collected about you. Except for companies who are directly involved with the operations of our website, we do not sell, share or disclose personal information we collect with any third parties. These Privacy Policy and Rules govern your use of the websites located at www.partyfowl.com. Please read these Party Fowl Privacy Policy and Rules carefully before using the Website.

SCOPE OF POLICY

This policy applies to Party Fowl  treatment of personally identifiable information that Party Fowl collects through Party Fowl Website and when you use Party Fowl services. The policy does not apply to practices of companies whose websites may be linked to Party Fowl. For access to the privacy policies of such linked websites please refer to the information provided by such websites at their home pages. Also see the paragraph below under the heading “Hypertext Links.”

Party Fowl respects your privacy. Accordingly, it has adopted the following privacy policy. This policy notifies you of:

what personally identifiable information of yours is collected from you through our Website; the organization collecting the information; how the information is used; with whom the information may be shared; what choices are available to you regarding collection, use and distribution of the information; the kind of procedures we employ in an effort to hinder the unauthorized access, deletion, alteration, use or disclosure of information you provide to 3st; and how you can correct any inaccuracies in the information you provide to us.

As we operate internationally, and our computer systems are currently based in the United States, your personal data will be processed by us in the U.S. where data protection and privacy regulations may not offer the same level of protection as in other parts of the world, such as the European Union.

INFORMATION COLLECTION AND USE

We may collect personally identifiable information (your name, address, telephone number, age and email address) when you voluntarily subscribe to a service offered on our Website. This information is used solely by Party Fowl or other companies who are involved in the operation of the Website. Party Fowl does not sell, share or disclose this information to third parties.

Party Fowl does not seek to collect such information from persons under the age of 18. If you are under the age of 18, please do not submit any such information to us. If you are the parent or guardian of a person under the age of 18 who has provided such information to us, please inform us by emailing us at marketing@partyfowl.com and we will remove such information from our database.

USE OF COOKIES

Cookies are pieces of information that a website transfers to any individual’s hard drive for record-keeping purposes. Cookies make web-surfing easier for you by saving your passwords, purchases, and preferences while you’re at our site. The use of cookies is an industry standard—you’ll find them at most major websites.

By showing how and when guests use the site, cookies help us see which areas are popular and which are not. Many improvements and updates to the site are based on such data as total number of visitors and pages viewed. This information is most easily tracked with cookies. If you accept the first tracking cookie from www.partyfowl.com, you won’t be offered as many afterwards.

Most browsers are initially set to accept cookies. If you’d prefer, you can set yours to refuse cookies or to alert you when cookies are being sent. However, it is possible that some parts of the site, like the shopping areas, may not function properly if you do so.

MANAGING YOUR INFORMATION

You are entitled to request access to and correction of all your personal data collected by us via the Website, as well as to require us to delete your data if you no longer want us to process it. You can make such a request or a related inquiry by emailing us at marketing@partyfowl.com. You can find out more details by emailing us as provided above. We will keep your data as long as it is reasonably necessary for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy and Rules. You may choose not to receive unsolicited marketing material from Party Fowl and you have the right to request deletion of your Party Fowl account information, subject to Party Fowl need to keep appropriate archives of its business operations.

ABOUT IP ADDRESSES

Party Fowl collects IP addresses for the purposes of system administration and to report aggregate information to our advertisers, if applicable. An IP address is a number that’s automatically assigned to your computer whenever you’re surfing the web. Web servers—the big computers that “serve” up web pages—automatically identify your computer by its IP address. When guests request pages from www.partyfowl.com, our servers log their IP addresses. We do not link IP addresses to anything personally identifiable. This means that a user’s session will be logged, but the user remains anonymous to us.

SECURITY

Party Fowl employs reasonable measures to maintain all personally identifiable information provided by you on computer servers in a controlled and secured environment in an effort to hinder unauthorized access, loss, alteration, use or disclosure of such information. However, the nature of the Internet is such that information may be transmitted over networks without appropriate security measures and may be accessed, deleted, altered, used or disclosed by unauthorized persons.

Because of the international nature of the services and products provided by the Website and the nature of Party Fowl business, personal data may, subject to applicable law, be transferred internationally throughout the world (details of which are available on request by emailing or calling us as provided above) for the purposes described above. This may mean that personal data are transferred to countries which do not have laws or regulations which protect personal data, such as the United States, where the servers for the Websites are located. We use reasonable measures to limit the disclosure of the data you provide to us only to certain staff within Party Fowl and its affiliates (i.e. staff whose job it is to process your inquiries and survey answers or otherwise to administer the Website, and those staff involved in the provision of Party Fowl services and products which may be of interest to you) and to require that they process the data only for the purposes identified in this Privacy Policy and Rules.

MODIFICATIONS TO THIS POLICY

Party Fowl may make modifications or amendments to this policy from time to time. In the event that such changes alter how Party Fowl gathers, processes, uses or discloses your personally identifiable information, Party Fowl will post such changes on our site.

Party Fowl is not responsible for the accuracy, relevance, timeliness, or completeness of those third party websites.
